## Tuesday, January 18

The master branch now contains an installer that'll fire up the platform in a virtual box. ðŸš€


## Installation

You must have Oracle's VM VirtualBox and Vagrant installed before continuing.

With the above installed, get the repo onto your machine (download, clone, etc.)  
Run the installer at the root of the project using the `./installer.sh` command. (Use [Windows GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) command line if on that OS - Windows' command line will not work.)

Add the following binding to your DNS settings:  
> `192.168.56.56        homestead.test`

Access WNGX by going to http://homestead.test. Start by clicking the Register link in the upper right corner.


## Introduction

Online web course platform. Public release still not ready for production systems.
  
  


## Laravel & Angular combo

Angular source files are in `/resources/frontend/webcourses`. They're served via Laravel's AngularController +Blade.

To recompile the Angular source code, run `npm run-script build:prod` in `/resources/frontend/webcourses/app/src`.
